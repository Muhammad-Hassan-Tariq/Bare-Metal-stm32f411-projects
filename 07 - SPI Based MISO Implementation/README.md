# 07 - SPI Based MISO Implementation

## Overview
- This project demonstrates a **SPI based data Transmission MISO Master In Slave Out** on the STM32F411 MCU.

## Hardware Setup  
- 1x Logic Analyzer
- Wire Logic Analyzer  |  STM32F411
       GND             |  GND
       CH0             |  PB3
       CH1             |  PB4
       CH2             |  PB5

## Working  
- SPI sends array having following characters "Hassan"
